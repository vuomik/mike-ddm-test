TAKE-HOME PROJECT

Please use AI to assist you for this project. There is no time limit but most candidates spend a few hours on this. We ask that you submit your assignment to Jordan at least 24 hours before your scheduled interview.

Create a small web app that lets users search for books. Use Vue/CSS/JS and a server-side orchestration layer in Node.js that proxies and transforms the Goodreads public API. The front end should provide a search bar where a user can enter text, and view that shows book results. The backend should contain an endpoint that accepts search and pagination info, connects to the Goodreads search API, transforms the XML into JSON and keeps RESTful practices in mind. It's up to you what metadata you'd like to render for each book, how you want to handle display states for pagination, errors, etc.

So that our team can review your code before the interview, we ask that you use an online dev environment to host your work. For the server, use codesandbox.io or any alternative that supports external package dependencies and provides a URL for us to run your app. The front end portion should be built using Codepen.io or an alternative; use its "Vue pen" templating or a standard HTML+CSS+JS template with manual App initialization. Both of these sites offer free signup. Share the URLs and any instructions needed for us to run your application prior to the interview.

Again, please use any AI tools you prefer. Part of the interview will include you walking us through the app and discussing your approach, your choices, etc.
